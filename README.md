# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
  In this challenge we are analyzing the results in math and reading tests of 15 different high schools. Due to a possible cheating on the tests of grade 9th of Thomas High Schools we are changing these results so they are not taking into account in the summary calculations. Also, we are analyzing how this change affects the results averages of the district and school grouping by size, type and budget.
## Results
  * The district summary did not get affected since the results ommited were not considerably big in comparison with the total of tests.
  * The school summary is affected because the math and reading test passing percentages for Thomas High School increase drastically.
  * Because of the changing in the percentages, Thomas High School gets on top of the list, showing a more higher performance in comparison with the other schools.
  * Math and reading scores by grade does not change much after changing the scores.
  * There is not an important change in the scores by size, type and spending of schools due to the changing of the grades.
## Summary
  After changing the scores we did not see a major change in the summary of the school by size, type, budget and grade. However, the Thomas High School showed a better performance in compariosn with the other schools.
